#Battleship

##A Turing School project by Tyler Noble & Siddharth Swaminathan

#To Run the game:

- Go to your terminal > Ruby spec/runner.rb > hit "enter"

###Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

- Iteration 3's lack of interaction pattern helped pave the way for creativity. It also allowed us to follow the given instructions and we were to interpret them to create our own code for how the game should work. This helped solidify our need for being able to follow written instructions to create something that will in fact work.  

###If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

- I would of liked to customize font. 

###Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

- We mostly divided and conquered. When something was implemented we would huddle and discuss what was placed into our code.

###Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

- Via slack, both text huddle chats, and some Github comments.
